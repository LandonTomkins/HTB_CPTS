HTTP Flow

 Our browsers usually first look up records in the local '/etc/hosts' file, and if the requested domain does not exist within it, then they would contact other DNS servers. We can use the '/etc/hosts' to manually add records to for DNS resolution, by adding the IP followed by the domain name.

HTTP Post request
When web application need to transfer file or move parameters from the URL they use POST
POST places the parameters within the HTTP request body
Benefits:
Lack of logging: POST request can transfer large files it would not be efficient for the request to use the URL for this
Less encoding requirements: URL’s are designed to be used with letters while POST request can place binary into the body of the request
More data can be sent: There is a max length of URL’s
CRUD
Create: POST
Read: GET
Update: PUT
Delete: DELETE
