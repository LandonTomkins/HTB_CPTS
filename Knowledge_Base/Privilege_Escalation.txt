PrivEsc Checklist:
    - once a box is compromised we want to throughly enumerate the box to find potential vulnerabilities to incease privilege level
    - HackTricks has a good checklist for both windows and linux privilege escalation

    - try sudo -l first and see what commands can be executed
        - look at the commands and check with GTFOBins website for commands
        - you can use sudo -u <user> command to execute sudo commands as a different user

THINGS TO LOOK FOR FROM PRIVESC SCRIPT OUTPUTS:
    - outdated kernels or OS 
    - Vulnerable Software
    - Scheduled Tasks
        - cron job for linux
            - if we can write to these files we may be able to edit the cron jobs and add a new job or execute malicious Software
                - /etc/crontab
                - /etc/cron.d
                - /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root 


    - exposed credentials
        - look for files that are readable and look for credentials


    - SSH Keys
        - found in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa
        - /root/.ssh/id_rsa
        - if public keys are found we can use them to login to the machine
        - if we are able to write to them then we could put our public keys
            - to generate our own key use 
                - ssh-keygen -f key (-f is to specify the output file)
                - and put the ken in /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys
